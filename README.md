# Anti-Distract
Trying to do something productive online and you always get distracted by other sites?
This program is designed to stop that!
This program allows you to either disable a preset of websites or block your own custom site so you can do what you need to do!

# How Does It Work
Inside of windows there is a file at "Windows/System32/dirvers/etc/hosts". This "hosts" file allows you to redirect any URL to an IP.
What this program does it take the site you want to block, and have the hosts file redirect it to a none-existant IP(0.0.0.0)

# Notes
I don't know how much this will be updated, right now i believe it is at its full capacity. That is why it is on here! I wanted
other people to be able to expand on this small idea of mine!

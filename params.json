{"name":"Block-Distract","tagline":"Block Those Distracting Websites AND GET BACK TO WORK!","body":"# Welcome to the GitHub page for Block-Distract\r\nOne day I was sitting down doing my online school, and hey, i thought about Youtube...next thing you know iv been on youtube for 2 hours and didn't get school done. That is one of the reasons for this program! This program blocks either a preset of distracting sites or allows you to block your own custom site.\r\n\r\n# How Does It Work?\r\nInside of Windows there is a file at \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\dirvers\\etc\\hosts\". This \"hosts\" file allows you to redirect any URL to an IP Address. What this program does it take the site you want to block and then has the \"hosts\" file redirect to a non-existent IP{0.0.0.0).\r\n\r\n# What Are The Presets?\r\nRight now the presets are\r\n\r\n### Youtube\r\n### Search Engines(Google, Bing, Yahoo, Ask)\r\n### Social Media(Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, GooglePlus, Tumblr, Pinterest, and Vine)\r\n### Email(Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook(Hotmail), Mail.com)\r\n### All(All sites listed here, not the whole web)\r\n\r\nThere is as also a \"Block Custom Site\" option which allows you to block your own site that you put the URL in for.\r\nOf course there is also an option to make every site available again.\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\nThe actually coding of the BAT file was done by Cubit-Games. The multi-colors in Batch was done by \"cecho.exe\" made by Elisherer on google code project listed here: https://code.google.com/p/cecho/\r\n\r\n## Support or Contact\r\nYou can contact me at \"cubitindustries@gmail.com\" for I guess...\"businessy\" stuff, for personal email its \"bricksinblocks@gmail.com\".","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

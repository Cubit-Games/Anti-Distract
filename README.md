# BlockDistract
This program helps you actually be productive by blocking distractions on the internet.

How does it work?
Inside of Windows there is a file located at C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts. Inside of this "hosts" file you can redirect
websites to IPs. What this program does is it takes the site/sites you want to block, and puts code in the "hosts" file that redirects
that/those URL/URLs to a non existant IP (0.0.0.0).

Mutli-Colors In Batch File: elisherer for making "cecho.exe", that is what allows this program to have multi-color
inside of a Windows Batch file.

# Notes
I'm not sure how much this program will be updated, I quite frankley believe that it's at its full capacity right now, but thats
why i put it on GitHub, so i can let other people expand on this small idea created by a 13 year old!

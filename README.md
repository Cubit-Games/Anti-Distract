# BlockDistract
This program helps you actually be productive by blocking distractions on the internet.

How does it work?
Inside of Windows there is a file located at C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts. Inside of this "hosts" file you can redirect
websites to IPs. What this program does is it takes the site/sites you want to block, and puts code in the "hosts" file that redirects
that/those URL/URLs to a non existant IP (0.0.0.0).

Mutli-Colors In Batch File: elisherer for making "cecho.exe", that is what allows this program to have multi-color
inside of a Windows Batch file.

# Notes
I'm not sure how much this program will be updated, I quite frankley believe that it's at its full capacity right now, but thats
why i put it on GitHub, so i can let other people expand on this small idea created by a 13 year old!

This program is designed to stop that!
This program allows you to either disable a preset of websites or block your own custom site so you can do what you need to do!

# How Does It Work
Inside of windows there is a file at "Windows/System32/dirvers/etc/hosts". This "hosts" file allows you to redirect any URL to an IP.
What this program does it take the site you want to block, and have the hosts file redirect it to a none-existant IP(0.0.0.0)
